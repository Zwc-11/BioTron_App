During the JamHacks 8 Hackathon, we made this project and won the Best Hardware Award.

Our company "BioTron" offers intelligent solutions with an automatic watering system to keep plants thriving while you're away. Our diverse range of self-watering planters ensures that whether you have a single plant or a garden, your plants receive the best care they needâ€”self-watering planters.

# App

This Android app can control the water pump and receive moisture levels from the moisture sensor, and we used a JSON file to send and receive data. The App app also has a schedule page, allowing users to set their preferred time to water the plant. We have an AI feature Appour called p. We used Pl@ntnet API to recognize the plant name and send the name to OPEN AI API to give users recommendations on raising this plant.
